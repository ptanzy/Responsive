# Responsive
Two responsive version of the page are in this repo. Responsive uses @Media queries and Bootstrap uses Bootstrap CSS classes.

Navbar links to the main, about, portfolio and skills pages. Each of the pages has a similar style with the navbar on top, the footer is links to social media and a background image. The main page has a title, the about page has an about section and javascript controlled image gallary. The porfolio has links to projects hosted on github and the skills has images for general skills. Other interesting features in addition to the image gallary are the fa social media icons which are style with css to grow and fade on hover with a timed transition. There is also a svg link on the navbar to return to the main page.
