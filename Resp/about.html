                <p>
                    I love to code! I really enjoy the problem solving and analytical aspects in programming. I work in the 
                    field, having two years experience coding in JavaScript. I have used such technolgies as D3.js, Node.js,
                    and PptxGenJS. I have some experience with ExtJS and Express.
                    <br><br>
                    Some of my hobbies are exercising, hikings, and photography. My passions include writing and reading, as
                    well as cooking anything Italian. I love to toss some pizza dough or roll out some pasta dough. There is
                    nothing I love more than fresh pesto!
                    <br><br>
                    I hope you enjoy looking through some of my work (click on the image to advance to the next).

    <!-- I really enjoyed this homework and feel like I learned a lot doing it. While I had familiarity with css it really helped
         to reinforce everything. I did hit some speedbumps with the css, but I was able to google and fix the issue. I'd like to
        know how I can improve the CSS in this. -->
